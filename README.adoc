= **Openshift on Proxmox**

:imagesdir: img

toc::[]

== [aqua]**Prerequisites**

Before you start, Download and install Proxmox from : https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads/category/iso-images-pve

image::Proxmox.png[500,500]

Installation process can be found on youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OVaWaqO2aU

The installation is easy, Flash the downloaded iso on a thumb drive and use it to boot your server from USB and follow the prompt. 

NOTE: Setup the storage after installation of Proxmox based on your harware and storage availibility.

=== [aqua]**Setup networking **

To simplify the process and make sure this would work on most common home routers we need to setup the proxmox to use an internal network IP for our VMs. 

Login to your Proxmox UI using the browser and create a new Linux Bridge as shown here:

image::vmbr1Create.png[1000,1000]
image::vmbr1Values.png[500,500]


Now ssh to you pve(proxmox) box.

To make sue you can access OCP and and infra from your laptop we need to add some port forwarding to the network we just created "vmbr1"
you can find a sample interface file in "Proxmox-OCP-Installer/tree/master/proxmox/templates" folder named "interfaces-proxmox" this is a full sample but you need to add this section under the vmbr1 in your "interface" file: 

```
  vi /etc/network/interfaces
```
   
```
  post-up echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
        post-up   iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s '192.168.60.0/24' -o vmbr0 -j MASQUERADE
        post-down iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -s '192.168.60.0/24' -o vmbr0 -j MASQUERADE
        post-up iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i vmbr0 -p tcp --dport 2222 -j DNAT --to 192.168.60.10:22
        post-down iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i vmbr0 -p tcp --dport 2222 -j DNAT --to 192.168.60.10:22

        post-down iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i vmbr0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 192.168.60.10:80
        post-up iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i vmbr0 -p tcp --dport 6443 -j DNAT --to 192.168.60.10:6443
        post-down iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i vmbr0 -p tcp --dport 6443 -j DNAT --to 192.168.60.10:6443

        post-down iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i vmbr0 -p tcp --dport 8080 -j DNAT --to 192.168.60.10:8080
        post-up iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i vmbr0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to 192.168.60.10:443
        post-down iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i vmbr0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to 192.168.60.10:443
        post-up iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i vmbr0 -p tcp --dport 8081 -j DNAT --to 192.168.60.10:8081
        post-down iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i vmbr0 -p tcp --dport 8081 -j DNAT --to 192.168.60.10:8081
```

This will make sure you can access what we will install later on infra box and Openshift, you need to do one more thing before you can access all routes on OCP.
You need to create a static route on your Router or for testing if you are using mac you can do the following:

```
   sudo route -n add -net 192.168.60.0/24 192.168.1.74
```


NOTE: replace the ips if you have created a differnt subnet for your VMs and the your proxmox has a differnt IP 


== [aqua]**Create your infra VM**

We need to create a VM that will contain external Dependencys for OCP installation. This box would act as: 

* [big]__Haproxy__: External load balancer for OCP masters

* [big]__Apache Webserver__: To host RHCOS images for OCP installation 

* [big]__PXE__: For PXE booting our OCP nodes

image::infra.png[100,100]

You can install CentOS stream 8 or RHEL 8 as the OS.

You can download CentOS from :
https://www.centos.org/download/

Upload downloaded iso to storage on proxmox: 

image::CreateVM0.png[500,500]

Now we can create our first VM by clicking on "Create VM" at the top right of proxmox UI and follow the following steps.


image::CreateVM2.png[500,500]

image::CreateVM3.png[500,500]

Select the storage you want to store your VM disk and set the value to 30 GiB.

=== [aqua]**Installing ansible and git**

To clone this repo and execute the script you need to install these two packages :

for centos follow these steps: 

```
   ssh <your new vm>
   sudo dnf makecache
   sudo dnf install epel-release
   sudo dnf makecache
   yum -y install ansible git
```
=== {aqua}** lets finish the Proxmox installation
   
   Lets setup the DNS that is requierd for Openshift installation. There is template file in the template folder so we just  need to run the following command to build and push the dnsmasq to our PVE box:

```
   ansible-playbook Setup-proxmox.yml
```

== [aqua]**Prep Infra/Helper Box**

Clone this git repo into the VM you just created above
```
  git clone https://github.com/Keyvan-rh/Proxmox-OCP-Installer.git
  cd Proxmox-OCP-Installer
  cd proxmox
```
In this folder there are multiple yaml files for:

     * Preping/Creating your OCP cluster: CreateCluster.yml

     * Removing OCP cluster from your Proxmox: DeleteCluster.yml

     * Setup variables for intstallation: vars.yml

=== [aqua]**Customization and Preparation**

There are couple places that you need to add your local and personal information before you can run the installer.

==== [big teal]__**proxmox/vars.yml**__

Before we start installing OCP cluster we need to update this file with your environment data. You need the folowing information: 

[square]
* IP address of your proxmox server
* Name of your Proxmox server (default is pve)
* domain name you like to use for OCP installation.
* If you would like you can change the clusterID as well this is usefull if you are planning to have multiple OCP cluster installed.
* IP address of the new VM that is acting as Infra/Helper
* NFS serever information, IP address and the exported path  

```
proxmox:
   ip: <IP address of your proxmox server>
   name: 'pve'
clusterID: ocp4
domain: < you domain : example.lab >
ext_haproxy_ip: <IP address of your Infra/Helper server>
nfs_provisioner:
   - {ip: '<IP address of nfs server>', path: '<export path on nfs server>' }
```
The CreateCluster ansible script will use this data to setup your infra/helper and VMs for OCP cluster. 

NOTE: Pay particular attention to the Mac addresses and IP addresses assiged to each machine if these are used in your network you can modified to fit your environment.

==== [big teal]__**templates/install-config.yml**__


In this file you need to add your continer registery Pull secret

```
   pullSecret: < Add your Pull secret from cloud.redhat.com > 
   sshkey: < Add your ssh pub key >

```

image::PullSecret1.png[500,500]
image::PullSecret2.png[500,500]
image::PullSecret3.png[500,500]
image::PullSecret4.png[500,500]
image::PullSecret5.png[500,500]

NOTE: Create your own ssh key and add the public key to this file.

```
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -N ''
```
Add your pub key to the authorized_keys on the proxmox box so the user that would run the ansible playbook can ssh to box with no password.

=== [aqua]**Setup Infra/Helper box**

It is time to setup Infra box by installing and configure requiered pakages, open necessary ports, setuping up PXE boot and lot more.

Lets do it by executing the following command in this folder: Proxmox-OCP-Installer/proxmox

```
   ansible-playbook CreateCluster.yml --tags build_infra 
```

=== [aqua]** Validate the infra/Helper box **

lets validate that all the parts are installed and startup: Haproxy: Using your browser and go to the following links

```
   http://<ifra IP address>:9000/
```
image::lb_validate.png[500,500]

```
   http://<ifra IP address>:8080
```
image::apache.png[500,500]



== [aqua]** Install Openshift 4.x **

Before installing the OCP cluster we need to get the correct version of openshift installer and the RHCOS, then create the ignition files and place them in correct locations. To do that we need to execute the following command: 
```
   ansible-playbook CreateCluster.yml --tags prep_install
```

=== [aqua]** Validate preperation step  **

```
   http://<infra IP address>:8080/install
```
image::rhcos.png[500,500]

```
   http://<infra IP address>:8080/ignition
```
image::ignition.png[500,500]

Check if all auto pxe config files has been generated with correct mac address:

```
ls /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg
```
image::pxe.png[500,500]

=== [aqua]** installing Openshift 4.x Cluster  **

At this point we have everything we need to install openshift cluster, so lets run the OCP installation:

```
   ansible-playbook CreateCluster.yml --tags install_ocp
```  

This will take 40 to 50 minutes so go get to coffee and do other work that you push back till we setup your OCP cluster.

NOTE: you can check the progress of installation in your command like and by going to looking at the external load balancer. first the bootstap will start and the end point will go green on the load balancer. When that is done the masters will start and after a while you should see their end points go green. AT this point the bootstarp will be shutdown and worker nodes will start.  

=== [aqua]** log in to your new OCP **

You can access the Openshift UI at the following URL just replace the ClusterID and domain section with what you have configured in vars.yml

https://console-openshift-console.apps.<ClusterID>.<domain> 

User: kubeadmin
Password: the password is print out at the end of the script. if you missed it you can go to the Infra/Helper VM go to were you clone the project and cd to "Proxmox-OCP-Installer" then run 51-wait-for-complete.sh this will print out all the info you need for your cluster.

the automated script has installed ocp cluster and internal container registery but the registery is set to use the local storage which is fine for the home lab. 

NOTE: if you would like to configure your registery to use your NAS you can execute the 61-setup-registery.sh and update the storage from "" to
```
```
